OpenThermÔ Protocol Specification v2.2    Introduction

1.  Introduction 
1.1  Background 
The trend in boiler technologies towards high-efficiency appliances with gas/air modulation and increased 
sophistication in control electronics has created a requirement for system communication between boilers 
and room controllers. At the higher end, home-systems buses provide extensive communications capability 
and several such systems are available, although no single standard has emerged. Generally, they all require 
hardware/software solutions whose cost is significant at the lower-end of the market, especially for point-topoint
 systems. Several proprietary solutions at this low-end have been developed, but offer no crosscompatibility
 with products from different manufacturers. 
 
There is an increasing demand for a new standard to be established to connect room controllers and boilers 
in a simple point-to-point fashion with very low entry-level costs. OpenTherm was developed to meet this 
requirement. 
1.2  Key OpenTherm Characteristics 
· Compatibility with so-called “dumb” or non-intelligent boiler systems. 
· Compatibility with low-cost entry-level room thermostats. 
· Compatible with electrical supplies typically normally available within boilers. 
· Two-wire, polarity-free connection for concurrent power supply and data transmission. 
· Provides a suitable power supply for a room controller so that it can operate without the need for an 
additional power source such as batteries. 
· Implementable in low-cost microcontrollers with small ROM / RAM / CPU-speed requirements. 
· Installer friendly feature for boiler testing. Shorting the wires at the boiler provides a simulated maximum 
heat demand (similar to current on/off systems). 
· Allows for the transfer of sensor, fault and configuration data between the devices. 
· Provides a mandatory minimum set of data objects, which allows for transmission of a modulating control 
signal from the room controller to the boiler. 
 
One of the key characteristics of the OpenTherm standard is the two-level approach which allows analoguetype
 solutions at the low-end. 
 
OT/+  The OpenTherm/plus protocol provides a digital communications system for data-exchange between 
two microprocessor-based devices. 
OT/-  The OpenTherm/Lite protocol uses a PWM signal and simple signalling capabilities to allow 
implementation on analogue-only products. 
 
Both protocols use the same physical layer for data transmission and power-feeding ensuring that the two 
levels of communications are physically compatible.

Ó1996,’98,’,’00 The OpenTherm Association    Page 7 
1.3  Document Overview 
This document specifies a communication system for use with boilers and room controls, which can also be 
applied to similar devices in the same or related applications. The characteristics and communications  
features of the both the infrastructure and the attached devices are specified in detail. This document does 
not provide a prescriptive solution for OpenTherm-compatible controllers, but rather specifies the 
requirements for such a solution.  
 
This document is divided into the following sections : 
 
1. Introduction  provides an overview of the background and key features of the 
OpenTherm communications system and defines some terms used in 
the document. 
2. System Overview  gives a top-level architectural view of the target application system and 
explains OpenTherm in relation to the OSI reference model and outlines 
the process for ensuring product compliance. 
3. Physical Layer  describes the characteristics of the physical medium and the method for 
bit-level signalling. 
4. OT/+ DataLink Layer  describes the composition of OpenTherm/plus frames and allowable 
conversation formats. 
5. OT/+ Application Layer  defines data objects and the mechanisms for transfer of application data 
between the boiler and room controllers. 
6. OT/- Encoding/Application data  describes the special mechanisms for transferring data in the 
OpenTherm/Lite system. 
Note regarding v2.1 of this specification: The new version of this spec defines more mandatory data-ids than 
the versions 1.x. and 2.0 This important difference means that devices which are compatible with v1.x or 2.0, 
may not be compatible with v2.1. However backward compatibility at a functional level should not be affected.

2.  System Overview 
2.1  System Architecture and Application Overview 
OpenTherm is a point-to-point communication system and connects boilers with room controllers, therefore it 
is not possible to connect several boilers or room controllers in the manner of bus-based systems. 
OpenTherm assumes that the room controller is calculating a heating demand signal in the form of a water 
temperature Control Setpoint based on room temperature error (or other control form, e.g. OTC) which it 
needs to transmit to the boiler so that the it can control the output of the boiler. The boiler in turn can transmit 
fault and system information to the room controller for display or diagnostics. A large number of data items 
are defined in the OT/+ Application Layer Protocol, covering these and many other pieces of system data. 
 
OpenTherm
Boiler Room Controller
 
2.2  Provision for Future Architectures/Expansion 
The OpenTherm communication system is designed to allow for future expansion at the application layer by 
provision of reserved data-ids and at the data-link layer by the use of reserved (spare) bits within the frame. 
  In 
order 
to 
address 
applications 
which 
would 
normally 
require 
a
 
bus-based 
communications 
system, 
it 
is 
conceived that intermediate gateways / interface devices would manage multiple OpenTherm 
communications lines. In the example below, the interface device acts as a “virtual boiler” to the room 
controller and acts as a “virtual room unit” to the boiler. In this way, other devices can be addressed while 
maintaining the basic point-to-point approach.

All future revisions of the OpenTherm Protocol Specification must be approved by the Members of The 
OpenTherm Association. 
2.3  Product Compliance and Marking 
All products marked with the OpenTherm logo must comply with the requirements of this document. The 
OpenTherm logo, trademark and the protocol can only be used with the permission of The OpenTherm 
Association. The OpenTherm Association is responsible for compliance testing procedures and licensing. 
 
· A boiler or room controller can be marked with the OpenTherm logo if it conforms to the specification 
contained herein for OT/+. 
· A boiler or room controller can not be marked with the OpenTherm logo if it only conforms to the 
specification contained herein for OT/-. 
 
When a room unit which can operate both in OT/+ and OT/- modes is connected to a boiler controller, some 
configuration needs to take place to determine which protocol to use. This configuration should be achieved 
automatically as follows : 
 
On power-up or after the physical connection is made, the room unit tries to communicate using OT/+ 
messages. If the boiler controller does not respond to one of these messages after 20 seconds, then the 
room unit switches to using OT/- signalling. 
 
An OT/+ boiler controller must start communications within this 20 second period or future OT/+ 
communications will not be possible unless the room unit is reset or re-connected.

2.4  Protocol Reference Model 
In order to describe the OpenTherm system, it is split up into an layered architecture based on the OSI 
Reference Model. The OSI/RM is an abstract description  of inter-process data communication. It provides a 
standard architecture model that constitutes the framework for the development of standard protocols.  The 
OSI/RM defines the functions of each of 7 defined layers and the services each layer provides to the layers 
above and below it. OpenTherm is only described in terms of the functions of the layers. Inter-layer 
communication is considered an implementation issue. The diagram below shows the  OpenTherm 
Reference Model.

The Application Layer is responsible for transfer of application data between the application software in the 
boiler and room controllers. It defines data-classes, data-id numbers and format of data-values for 
transmission. It also specifies the minimum AL support for all OpenTherm-compatible devices. 
 
The Data-Link Layer is responsible for building the complete frame incorporating the AL data-id and value 
and calculating the error-check code. It defines message types and conversation formats and performs errorchecking
 on a received frame. It regulates the flow of information on the line. 
 
The Physical Layer defines the electrical  and mechanical characteristics of the medium and the mechanism 
for transmission of a bit, including bit-level encoding. It also performs bit-level error checking on an incoming 
frame(OT/+)

3.2  Signal Transmission Definition 
The system operates by sending current signals from the boiler unit to the room unit and voltage signals in 
the reverse direction.  
 
The physical idle state of the line is a low-power consumption state i.e. low current and low voltage. Note that 
all specifications should be fulfilled within the complete temperature range in which the device is in use.

It is the intention that OpenTherm provides suitable power from the boiler unit to the room unit such that no 
additional power connection or use of batteries is required for the room unit. 
3.3.1  Options 
The options for supplying power to an OpenTherm room unit are : 
  i)   line 
(
OpenTherm-supplied) 
power 
ii)  local supply (mains, batteries or other independent power source) 
 
Any OpenTherm room unit is permitted to use line-power (provided that its requirements are met by the 
available current and voltage), or are free to exercise option (ii) above. 
3.3.2  Power-Feed Characteristics 
3.3.2.1  Room Unit Current 
Guaranteed current available from the line is the minimum allowable idle signalling current (5 mA). This 
includes the current necessary to operate the regulator which develops the supply voltage in the room unit. 
 
Room unit current consumption :  5 mA max. 
3.3.2.2  Room Unit Voltage 
The minimum voltage available to supply the room unit circuitry is a function of the implementation of the 
room unit communications interface. It is directly related to the Idle Line voltage and to the voltage drops 
associated with the polarity management circuitry and the voltage signalling circuit in idle state. 
As a guide, a nominal voltage of 3.3V is achievable with a low cost implementation of the interface. 
3.3.2.3  Connection polarity 
The room unit shall provide the functionality to operate regardless of polarity of the line signal. 
3.3.2.4  Galvanic isolation 
The boiler interface shall provide safety isolation from the mains power line (ref. EN60730-1). 
3.4  OpenTherm/plus Bit-Level Signalling 
3.4.1  Bit Encoding Method 
Bit encoding method    :  Manchester / Bi-phase-L 
Bit value ‘1’    :  active-to-idle transition 
Bit value ‘0’    :  idle-to-active transition 
 
OpenThermÔ Protocol Specification v2.2    Physical Layer 
Ó1996,’98,’99,’00 The OpenTherm Association    Page 16 
Active
Idle
Bit value = ‘’ Bit value = ‘’
 
 
Manchester encoding is a self-clocking code giving the advantage of bit-synchronisation since there is always 
at least one transition in the middle of the bit-interval. It also has a fixed average d.c. component over the 
frame of half the idle and active levels which allows greater predictability of power supply requirements, and 
additionally the absence of an expected transition can be used to detect errors. 
  
Example 
    1        0        0         1        1         1         0        1

Bit rate    :  1000 bits/sec nominal 
Period between mid-bit transitions  :  900μs .. 1150μs  (nominal 1ms) 
 
Timing should be reset on each transition so that any timing errors do not accumulate

3.4.3  Bit-level Error Checking 
The primary error-checking method in OpenTherm is provided through the Manchester encoding. 
Manchester validity should be checked by the receiver and the data frame rejected if an error is detected. 
3.5  Special Installation Short-Circuit Feature 
The boiler unit must support an important installation feature which allows the terminals at the boiler to be 
short-circuited to simulate a heat demand such as can be done with existing on/off boilers. The boiler unit 
should interpret the short-circuit as a heat demand within15 secs of the short-circuit being applied. This must 
be supported by both OT/+ and OT/- boilers.  
  It 
is 
allowable 
that 
this 
can 
implemented 
by 
a
 
software-detection 
method. 
The 
software 
short-circuit 
condition 
is defined as a low-voltage state (Vlow) with no valid communications frame for at least 5 seconds.

4.  OpenTherm/plus DataLink Layer Protocol 
4.1  Overview 
The data-link layer is responsible for the following functions : 
 
· builds the complete frame from the information passed to it from the application layer. 
· performs error-checking on an incoming frame. 
· defines message types and allowable conversation exchanges. 
4.2  Frame Format 
Data is transmitted in 32 bit frames, with an added start bit (‘1’) at the beginning and stop bit (‘1’) at the end. 
 
The frame format is identical for both directions, being laid out as follows: 
 
  Start bit (1)        Stop bit (1) 
  |   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<           32-BIT FRAME           >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  | 
  |   <------------BYTE 1 --------------->  <------------BYTE 2 ---------------> <------------BYTE 3 ---------------> <------------BYTE 4 --------------->  | 
  |  Parity bit (1)        | 
  |  |  Message Type (3)      | 
  |  |  |        | 
             
1  P  MSG-TYPE  SPARE(4)  DATA-ID(8)  DATA-VALUE(16)  1 
     MSB             LSB  MSB                       LSB  MSB                                                              LSB   MSB                                                                                                                                            LSB   
 
Elements of the frame structure are described  in the following sections. 
4.2.1  Parity Bit - P 
The parity bit should be set or cleared such the total number of ‘1’ bits in the entire 32 bits of the message is 
even. 
4.2.2  Message Type - MSG-TYPE 
The message type determines the contents and meaning of the frame. Seven of the eight possible values for 
the message type are defined.

011  -reserved-    111  UNKNOWN-DATAID 
4.2.3  Spare Data - SPARE 
These bits are unused in this release of the protocol. They should always be ‘0’. 
4.2.4  Data Item Identifier - DATA-ID 
The DATA-ID is an 8 bit value which uniquely identifies the data item or items being transmitted. A full list of 
data ID’s and corresponding data items are listed in the OT/+ Application Layer section. 
4.2.5  Data Item Value - DATA-VALUE 
This contains the 16 bit value of the data item corresponding to the frame’s data identifier. In some 
messages, the data-value is composed of two separate items, each of 8-bits in length. These will be denoted 
as DATA-BYTE1 and DATA-BYTE2. 
4.3  Conversation Format 
4.3.1  Overview 
OpenTherm data transfer consists of a series of ‘conversations’ between the devices controlled by a strict 
master/slave relationship. OpenTherm requires that the control device, e.g. a room unit, is always the master 
and the control plant, e.g. a boiler, is always the slave. 
  In 
all 
cases 
the 
master 
initiates 
a
 
conversation 
by 
sending 
a
 
single 
frame. 
The 
slave 
is 
expected 
to 
respond 
with a single frame reply within a defined period of 20ms to 800ms from the end of the master transmission. 
The master unit must wait 100ms from the end of a previous conversation before initiating a new 
conversation. The master must communicate at least every 1 sec (+15% tolerance). 
 
This timing is shown below 
slave
master
min: 20ms
max: 800ms
min: 100ms
Maximum : 1.15 sec
 
OpenThermÔ Protocol Specification v2.2    OT/+ DataLink Layer 
Ó1996,98,’99 The OpenTherm Association    Page 20 
A conversation is limited to a single exchange of frames. Three types of conversation are possible, listed in 
the next section. 
4.3.2  Message Notation 
In the rest of this section and in the OT/+ Application Layer Protocol section, a function-style notation is used 
to describe the various messages in order to aide explanation. 
 
<msg-type> ( id=<data-id>, <data-value>) 
represents a message with msg-type=<msg-type>, data-id =<data-id> and data-value = <data-value>. 
 
<msg-type> ( id=<data-id>, <data-byte1>, <data-byte2>) 
represents a message with msg-type=<msg-type>, data-id =<data-id> and data-value = <databyte1>&<
data-byte2>. 
 
e.g.  READ-DATA (id=1, ControlSetpoint-value) 
READ-DATA (id=11, TSP-index, 00) 
 
4.3.3  Default Data-Values 
For some messages, no “real” data is being sent. e.g. in a normal Read-Data request. The data-value will be 
set to a default value of zero. i.e. two bytes of 0x00 and 0x00. 
4.4  Conversation Details 
4.4.1  Read-Data Request 
READ-DATA (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE) 
 
The master is requesting a data value, specified by the data identifier, from the slave. The message type sent 
by the master is ‘Read-Data’, as shown above. Typically no data-value is sent and a value of 0x0000 will be 
used, but in some circumstances the master may, although it is requesting a value from the slave, also send 
a value to the slave with this message e.g. for data-verification. This is defined by the OT/+ Application Layer 
protocol. 
 
The slave should make one of the three possible responses listed below:  
 
· READ-ACK (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE,) 
If the data ID is recognised by the slave and the data requested is available and valid. The value of the data 
item is returned.
· DATA-INVALID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE) 
If the data ID is recognised by the slave but the data requested is not available or invalid. DATA-VALUE can be 
0x0000 in this case.
· UNKNOWN-DATAID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE) 
If the slave does not recognise the data identifier. DATA-VALUE can be 0x0000 in this case.

Ó1996,98,’99 The OpenTherm Association    Page 21 
4.4.2  Write-Data Request 
WRITE-DATA (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE) 
 
The master is writing a data value, specified by the data identifier, to the slave. The message type sent by the 
master is ‘Write-Data’, as shown above. 
 
The slave should make one of the three possible responses listed below: (Note that DATA-VALUE may be 
modified by the slave in some circumstances.) 
 
· WRITE-ACK (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE)
If the data ID is recognised by the slave and the data sent is valid.
· DATA-INVALID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE)
If the data ID is recognised by the slave but the data sent is invalid.
· UNKNOWN-DATAID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE)
If the slave does not recognise or does not support the data identifier.
4.4.3  Writing Invalid Data 
  INVALID-DATA 
(
DATA-ID, 
DATA-VALUE) 
 
A data item to be sent by the master may be invalid in a particular application, but may still require to be sent. 
In this case the master may use the message type ‘data invalid’. 
 
The slave should make one of the two possible responses listed below: (Note that DATA-VALUE may be 
modified by the slave in some circumstances.) 
 
· DATA-INVALID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE)
If the data ID is recognised by the slave.
 
· UNKNOWN-DATAID (DATA-ID, DATA-VALUE)
If the slave does not recognise or does not support the data identifier.
4.5  Frame Error Handling 
In all cases of errors being detected in the incoming frame, the partial frame is rejected and the conversation 
should be terminated. No errors are treated as recoverable. 
  If 
the 
slave 
does 
not 
respond, 
then 
the 
master 
should 
note 
that 
the 
conversation 
is 
incomplete. 
  If 
a
 
conversation 
is 
terminated 
the 
master 
should 
re-attempt 
the 
same 
conversation 
at 
the 
next 
appropriate 
scheduled time for communications.

5.  OpenTherm/plus Application Layer Protocol 
5.1  Overview 
The Application Layer of the OpenTherm protocol is divided into an Open-Area of data-item id’s and a Test & 
Diagnostic area for Member use. Id’s 0 .. 127 are reserved for OpenTherm pre-defined information, while id’s 
from 128 .. 255 can be used by manufacturers (members of the association) for test & diagnostic purposes 
only. The MemberID codes of the master and slave can be used to handshake between two compatible 
devices and enable the use of the Test & Diagnostic-Area data-items. MemberID codes are assigned and 
managed by The OpenTherm Association. 
 
There are seven classes of information defined in the Application Layer : 
 
Class 1.  Control and Status Information 
This class contains basic control information from the master and status information exchange 
(including fault status) and incorporates all the mandatory OpenTherm data. 
Class 2.  Configuration Information 
Information relating to the configuration of the master and slave and Member identification. 
Class 3.  Remote Commands 
This class allows for commands to be passed from the master to the slave. 
Class 4.  Sensor and Informational Data 
This class covers typically sensor temperatures, pressures etc. 
Class 5.  Remote Boiler Parameters 
These are parameters of the slave device which may be read or set by the master and are specific 
to boiler applications. 
Class 6.  Transparent Slave Parameters 
This class allows slave parameters to be read or set by the master without knowledge of their 
physical or application-specific meaning. 
Class 7.  Fault History Information 
This data allows historical fault information to be passed from the slave to the master. 
Class 8.  Control of Special Applications 
This class defines data id’s to be exchanged between the master and a application specific slave. 
  
Special abbreviations and data-types are used in the Application Layer Protocol section and are defined 
below : 
LB  low-byte of the 16-bit data field. 
HB  high-byte of the 16-bit data field. 
S>M  information flow from slave to master 
M>S  information flow from master to slave 
flag8  byte composed of 8 single-bit flags 
u8  unsigned 8-bit integer 0 .. 255 
s8  signed 8-bit integer -128 .. 127 (two’s compliment) 
f8.8  signed fixed point value : 1 sign bit, 7 integer bit, 8 fractional bits (two’s compliment ie. the 
LSB of the 16bit binary number represents 1/256th of a unit). 
u16  unsigned 16-bit integer 0..65535 
s16  signed 16-bit integer -32768..32767 
Example :  A temperature of 21.5°C in f8.8 format is represented by the 2-byte value 1580 hex 
(1580hex = 5504dec, dividing by 256 gives 21.5) 
A temperature of -5.25°C in f8.8 format is represented by the 2-byte value FAC0 hex 
(FAC0hex = - (10000hex-FACOhex) = - 0540hex = - 1344dec, dividing by 256 gives -5.25)

· All data-item ID’s are in decimal unless denoted otherwise. 
· “00” is used to represent the dummy data byte as defined in the Data-Link Layer and is transmitted when 
valid data-values are not available or appropriate. 
· For future compatibility, a bit or byte is marked as unused or reserved, should be set to 0 (zero) by the 
transmitter; however the receiver should ignore these bits/bytes, since they may be set in future versions 
of the  protocol. 
· ‘R’ and ‘W’ under the column labelled ‘Msg’, indicate whether the data object is supported with a Read or 
a Write command. 
5.2  Mandatory OT/+ Application-Layer Support 
It is required that OpenTherm-compliant devices support the following data items.

DATA_INVALID 
25  Boiler temperature  · Not mandatory  · Must respond with READ_ACK or 
DATA_INVALID (for example if

The slave can respond to all other read/write requests, if not supported, with an UNKNOWN-DATAID reply. 
Master units (typically room controllers) should be designed to act in a manner consistent with this rule.

5.3  Data Classes 
5.3.1  Class 1 : Control and Status Information 
This group of data-items contains important control and status information relating to the slave and master. 
The slave status contains a mandatory fault-indication flag and there is an optional application-specific set of 
fault flags which relate to specific faults in boiler-related applications, and an OEM fault code whose meaning 
is unknown to the master but can be used for display purposes.

Note :  The master decides the actual range over which the control setpoint is defined. The default range is 
assumed to be 0 to 100. 
 
There is only one control value defined - data-id=01, the control setpoint. The control setpoint ranges 
between a minimum of 0 and maximum of 100. It represents directly a temperature setpoint for the supply 
from the boiler. The slave does not need to know how the master has calculated the control setpoint, e.g. 
whether it used room control or OTC, it only needs to control to the value. Likewise, the master does not 
need to know how the slave is controlling the supply. 
 
The CHenable bit has priority over the Control Setpoint. The master can indicate that no CH demand is 
required by putting the CHenable bit  = 0 (ie CH is disabled), even if the Control Setpoint is non-zero.

Ó1996,’98,’99 The OpenTherm Association    Page 25 
 
The status exchange is a special form of conversation which should be initiated by the master by sending a 
READ-DATA(id=0,MasterStatus,00) message. The slave must respond with READ-ACK(id=0,MasterStatus, 
SlaveStatus) to send back the Slave Status information in the same single conversation. Since it is 
mandatory to support this data object, the slave cannot respond with DATA-INVALID or UNKNOWN-DATAID. A 
WRITE-DATA(id=0,…) from the master should not be used. 
5.3.2  Class 2 : Configuration Information  
This group of data-items defines configuration information on both the slave and master sides. Each has a 
group of configuration flags (8 bits) and an MemberID code (1 byte). A valid Read Slave Configuration and 
Write Master Configuration message exchange is recommended before control and status information is 
transmitted.

5.3.5  Class 5 : Pre-Defined Remote Boiler Parameters 
This group of data-items defines specific parameters of the slave device (setpoints, etc.) which may be 
available to the master device and may, or may not,  be adjusted remotely. These parameters are prespecified
 in the protocol and are specifically related to boiler/room controller applications. There is a 
maximum of 8 remote boiler parameters. Each remote-boiler-parameter has a upper- and lower-bound (max 
and min values) which the master should read from the slave in order to make sure they are not set outside 
the valid range. If the slave does not support sending the upper- and lower-bounds, the master can apply 
default bounds as it chooses. 
 
The remote-parameter transfer-enable flags indicate which remote parameters are supported by the slave. 
The remote-parameter read/write flags indicate whether the master can only read the parameter from the 
slave, or whether it can also modify the parameter and write it back to the slave. An Unknown Data-Id 
response to a Read Remote-Parameter-Flags message indicates no support for remote-parameters 
(equivalent to all transfer-enable flags equal to zero). In these flag bytes bit 0 corresponds to remote-boilerparameter
 1 and bit 7 to remote-boiler-parameter 8.

There are applications where it’s necessary to override  the room setpoint of the master (room-unit). 
For instance in situations where room controls are connected to home or building controls or room controls in 
holiday houses which are activated/controlled remotely. 
 
The master can read on Data ID 9 the remote override room setpoint. A value unequal to zero is a valid 
remote override room setpoint. A value of zero means no remote override room setpoint. ID100 defines how

6.  OpenTherm/Lite Data Encoding and Application Support 
OpenTherm / Lite uses the same medium and physical signalling levels as OpenTherm/plus as described in 
section 3. It can be implemented using the same hardware as for OT/+. 
6.1  Room Unit to Boiler Signalling 
The room unit transmits a PWM signal to the boiler. 
 
Vlow
Vhigh
Time
Voltage
tperiod
thigh tlow
 
Duty Cycle (%) = tlow / tperiod  ie. the % time over the period that the line is low. 
 
The Duty Cycle Period (tperiod) does not require to be constant. The frequency of the PWM signal must lie 
between 100Hz and 500Hz (2ms < tperiod < 10ms). The duty cycle can vary between 0% and 100%. 
6.2  Boiler to Room Unit Signalling 
The boiler signals only by changing the current between the Ilow and Ihigh states. The high current state 
represents the presence of a boiler lock-out fault. Different from OpenTherm/plus, it can permanently keep 
the line in the high current state. It is mandatory for the room and boiler controller to support the transmission 
and detection of this feature.

The tolerance of both generation and measurement of the Duty-Cycle signal should be less than ±2%. 
 
A Duty-Cycle less than 5% is used to indicate a CH-disabled state (ie “positive-off” or no CH-demand 
condition). It is not mandatory for the boiler controller to support this feature, or for the room unit to use it.
